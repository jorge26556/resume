    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jorge</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Action Movies</h2>
    <h3>Fast and Furious VII</h3>
    <p>I liked it but sometimes i got boring because the plot became repetitive in some scenes.</p>
    <h3>Lucy</h3>
    <p>A very interesting choice if you want to watch a action movie, the plot is so interesting and it catches you until the end.</p>
    <h3>The ilusionists</h3>
    <p>If you like the heist movies tihs is a good choice for you, the plot catches you once you start whatching the movie, just amazing!. </p>

    <h2>Horror Movies</h2>
    <h3>Saw</h3>
    <p>If you don´t like the gore things or you feel uncomfortable looking those things, i don´t recommend to you this movie, it has a lot of those scenes, the plot is good though.</p>
    <h3>The Conjuring</h3>
    <p>This one is one of my favorite horror movies by far, the plot is just crazy!</p>
    <h3>Chucky</h3>
    <p>As Saw movie it has some  gore scenes but not that much, otherwise the plot is good and it doesn't became boring. </p>
